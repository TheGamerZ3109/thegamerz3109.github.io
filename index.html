                i've been programming since I was very young with my father (probably around 7 years old? not sure it's been a while). my active development time has been around 3 and a half years now branching across ROBLOX with LuaU and TypeScript (with Roblox-TS), HTML, JavaScript, Python, C#, and C++. not all of these lanuages will have the same level of experience and I will only do payed work in ROBLOX (Lua or TypeScript) or very light JavaScript.
